1.Default config file is  nginx.conf
2. It is recommended to create separate virtual servers
for different applications.
3. A virtual server is defined by a server directive.
4. we can define virtual servers in separate .conf files, which
  should be present in /etc/nginx/conf.d
5. I am adding my nginx config files in configurations directory.
6. localhost.com.conf is conf file for one virtual server.
   It should be placed under conf.d folder.
7. Inside localhost.com.conf server_name is host1.example.com.
   In order to resolve this domain i have added it in /etc/hosts
   file. I have pasted its copy in configurations folder.
8. In hosts file 192.168.58.1 is my ip address.
